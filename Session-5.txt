Create a simple program that models a Vehicle hierarchy. The base class is Vehicle, the next level is Car (which inherits from Vehicle), and the final level is ElectricCar (which inherits from Car).

Each class should have its own properties and methods as described below:

Vehicle should have properties for Brand and Speed. It should have a method called DisplayDetails() that shows these details.
Car should add a property for FuelType and DisplayDetails() to include the fuel type.
ElectricCar should add a property for BatteryCapacity and DisplayDetails() to include the battery capacity.
Task:
Implement the classes Vehicle, Car, and ElectricCar using multilevel inheritance.
In the Main() method, create an instance of ElectricCar and set its properties.
Call the DisplayDetails() method to show the details of the electric car.
